### Hello there!

I'm Abdullah Dedeoğlu and welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎮 I'm a Jr. Game Developer working with Unity.

🎓 I'm a final year student studying Computer Engineering at Necmettin Erbakan University.

🕹️ I usually work on demos in various genres to learn Unity, striving to keep my game development skills diverse.

🚀 Currently, I'm working on a Physic Based Hyper Casual Game as Level Designer. As side projects, I occasionally create small-scale casual game demos to unwind.

🎵 Besides game development, I'm a musician who publishes songs on Spotify.
